## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **[Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)** for the map

## Getting Started

### Installation

To try out **GeoTrace** on your own computer:

#### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdolehSamuel/geotrace.git
cd geotrace
```

#### 2. (No dependencies needed!)

GeoTrace is just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You don't need to install anything for the frontend.

---

### Running the Application

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser:

```sh
open index.html
```

Or, right-click and select ‚ÄúOpen with‚Ä¶‚Äù in your favorite browser.

## How It Works

- When you load the page, GeoTrace asks the backend proxy for info about your current IP address (the one your internet provider gives you).
- You can also type any IP address or website (like `google.com`) into the search bar and hit enter.
- The app sends your search to a backend proxy server, which then talks to a third-party geolocation API (geo.ipify.org).
- The backend sends back info about the IP or domain, and GeoTrace shows it on the page and on the map.
- **Note:** GeoTrace does NOT use your device's GPS or the browser's Geolocation API. It only looks up info based on IP addresses or domain names.

---

## Deployment

You can put GeoTrace on any static web server (like GitHub Pages, Netlify or Vercel):

1. Upload everything in the `geotrace/` folder to your web server.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- **Problem:** Browsers block some requests to outside APIs for security reasons.
- **Solution:** GeoTrace uses a backend proxy server to fetch data from the geolocation API, so the frontend never runs into CORS issues.

### Challenge 2: Making the Map Easy to Use

- **Problem:** Showing the right location and updating the map smoothly.
- **Solution:** Used Leaflet.js, a simple JavaScript library for interactive maps, and made sure the map updates whenever you search.
